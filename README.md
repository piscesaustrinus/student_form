## Description

The **Student Enrollment Form** project is a web application designed to manage student enrollments in a school database. This form allows users to input student details such as Roll Number, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date, and then save, update, or reset the information stored in a `JsonPowerDB` (JPDB) database. The form is designed to be user-friendly, with validation checks and appropriate button states to guide the user through the data entry process.

## Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB

JsonPowerDB (JPDB) offers several benefits that make it an ideal choice for this project:

- **Simple to Use**: JPDB is straightforward and easy to use, with minimal setup required for basic CRUD operations.
- **High Performance**: It is designed for high performance and is significantly faster than traditional relational databases.
- **Schema-free**: Being a NoSQL database, JPDB doesn't require a fixed schema, allowing for flexible data storage.
- **Real-time**: Real-time updates and querying provide immediate feedback, which is excellent for dynamic web applications.
- **Cost-effective**: JPDB offers a cost-effective solution with its serverless architecture and efficient resource management.

## Release History

- **v1.0.0** (2024-08-29): Initial release of the Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB. Features include:
  - Basic form structure with input validation.
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) integrated with JPDB.
  - User-friendly interface with enable/disable functionalities for buttons and fields.
  - Local storage management for record handling.
